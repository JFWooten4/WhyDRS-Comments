# Regulatory Comment Work

This repo houses pending comment submissions crowdsourced amongst the community. For pending research items, check out the [Issues](https://github.com/WhyDRS/SEC-Comments/issues) tab, or learn more about what we're working on in [Discussions](https://github.com/WhyDRS/SEC-Comments/discussions).

Have something of your own you want to bring to the community? Open up a new file using [`template.md`](/template.md) and start building your own conversational letter progressing our markets! Final letters are exported from markdown to PDF and can always be submitted through official WhyDRS emails if desired, although we have a few relevant [`TIPS`](tips.md) in this area.
